The basics of object-oriented programming, including abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and the use of collections, are demonstrated in this Java program. A generic electronic device with basic features like turning on, turning off, and displaying details is represented by the abstract Device class. This class is inherited by various devices, each of which has unique characteristics and actions.
The program covers a variety of gadget kinds, including microwaves, televisions, air conditioners, and lamps. In order to display its specific information, each device overrides the details() function and has its own properties, such as temperature, brightness, channel, or timer. To produce a duplicate object, the LampShade class also demonstrates a copy constructor.
All devices are kept in a list and managed by the DeviceHelper class in the main procedure. This utility class can count the number of devices that are currently on and turn all of the devices on or off at once. All things considered, the application aids students in comprehending how polymorphism, abstract classes, method overriding, and object lists interact in a basic simulation of a smart home device.
