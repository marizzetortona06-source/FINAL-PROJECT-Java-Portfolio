This Java application shows how to use ideas from object-oriented programming, including inheritance, classes, objects, and arrays. Common features like name, age, and gender are contained in the Person class, which acts as the parent class. Because they both inherit from the Person class, the Student and Teacher classes can make advantage of these shared characteristics.

While the Teacher class contains a department and a list of courses taught, the Student class adds a student ID. A subject with a course code and course name is represented by the Course class. Students, teachers, and course objects are created and their data is shown in the main program. In a straightforward example of a school system, this software teaches pupils how inheritance functions and how various classes can interact with one another.
