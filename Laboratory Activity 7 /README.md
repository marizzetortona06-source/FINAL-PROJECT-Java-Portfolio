This Java application uses ideas from object-oriented programming, including abstraction, inheritance, interfaces, and packages, to replicate a basic online ordering system. An order with basic information such as order ID, amount, and status is represented by the abstract Order class. Additionally, it outlines standard procedures that should be used for all kinds of orders, like order processing and order summary presentation.
The Online Order class implements the Payable interface and extends the Order class. This implies that a payment can be made and an order processed online. The Payable interface mandates that a payment method be provided by any class implementing it. Additionally, the application uses an OrderStatus enum to show the many states of an order, including shipped, paid, pending, and cancelled.
Several online orders are made in the primary application and kept in a list. An iterator is used to process, pay for, and display each order. The remaining orders are displayed at the bottom of the list after cancelled orders are eliminated. With the aid of this software, students can learn how abstract classes, interfaces, collections, and enums interact in an actual online shopping setting.
