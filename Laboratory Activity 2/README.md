This program is a straightforward Java application that demonstrates the operation of classes and objects. Book objects containing details like title, author, publish date, and current page are created using the Book class. Additionally, it provides functions for updating the author of a book, changing the current page, and displaying book metadata. The MyBookList class creates and displays a number of book objects.
